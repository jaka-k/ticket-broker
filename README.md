- 4 web apps that are consumer applications of the eslint config, tsconfig and ui library 
- Was inteneded as a great showcase for RabbitMQ, but turned out to be a great example of monorepo usage as well
- The communication between the 4 frontends and the server is an representing a real world challange of multi regional ticket vendors 
- Go server with Mux 
- The 4 frontends are AMQP producer, where the Go server is an AMQP consumer
- When a user clicks one of the buttons, the frontend application generates a message. This message contains the details about the number of tickets being bought (+10 or +100).
- The Go server acts as a consumer in AMQP, an entity that connects to the message broker to receive messages and process them
- RabbitMQ as a Broker inbetween
- After processing the message, the server sends a confirmation back to the initial site (the frontend application) through RabbitMQ.

- I wanted the repo to be able to run withouth complete dockerization, with mostly turbo running everything except the rabbitmq image that is needed for the server


4 Web Apps for Ticket Booking:
- Each app represents a consumer application for different countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain).
- The applications use shared configuration and UI components, demonstrating efficient code reuse in a monorepo setup.

Monorepo with Turborepo:
- The project showcases an effective monorepo setup using Turborepo for managing multiple interconnected projects.
- The monorepo contains common configurations (ESLint, TypeScript), shared UI components, and individual applications for each country.

RabbitMQ for Messaging:
- RabbitMQ serves as the message broker between the frontends and the server, representing a real-world multi-regional ticket vendor system.
-The communication flow demonstrates an example of AMQP usage, with the frontends acting as producers and the server as a consumer.

Go Server with Mux:
- The server is implemented in Go using the Gorilla Mux router for handling HTTP requests.
- It processes messages from the RabbitMQ broker and sends confirmations back to the relevant frontend.

Consumer Setup:
- RabbitMQ queues are declared during server startup, ensuring necessary infrastructure is set up before processing begins.
- Utilizes concurrent processing through goroutines for efficient consumer initialization.
- The server processes messages based on the country code provided, and dispatches them to different queues accordingly.

Handling Ticket Purchases:
- When a user clicks one of the buttons on the frontend, a message is generated detailing the number of tickets being bought.
- The server processes these messages and sends confirmations back to the appropriate frontend.

Data Flow:
- The frontends send API requests to the Go server.
- The server validates and processes these requests, forwarding the messages to RabbitMQ.
- RabbitMQ distributes the messages to the appropriate queues for each country.

Fairness in Message Handling:
- The RabbitMQ broker ensures that ticket purchase requests are fairly distributed among the different countries, avoiding one country monopolizing the tickets.


// Todo:

Confirmation Workflow:
After processing the message, the server sends a confirmation message back to the originating frontend application.
The confirmation is sent through RabbitMQ, maintaining the asynchronous, decoupled communication flow.

Error Handling:
- The server includes robust error handling, providing clear feedback and maintaining consistent logging for monitoring purposes.
Logging and Monitoring:
- The Go server logs key actions and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring the applicationâ€™s health.


# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
